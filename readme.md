The user should be able to filter by category
the categories are:

- Type (series or movie)

The user should be able to view a description of the movie/series

Add to cart option should be available from the library of movies/series somewhere around the movie/series poster and when the user click the banner to display the description

The shopping cart button/image should appear in the top right corner and should update the number from 0 to 9, if the number exceed the 9 movies/series it should display a sign that represent numbers
